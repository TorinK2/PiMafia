PiMafia works the same way as normal mafia, but with the server in charge. The first user (client) connected decides basic game rules, specifically the number of users, the number of mafia in the game, and the number of doctors in the game. After the specified number of users have connected, the server randomly assigns the roles of mafia and doctors to users. If a user is neither mafia or doctor, they are simply a villager. Users are not informed of the roles of any of the other users in the game. Then, turns begin until someone wins the game. At the start of the turn, or "night," one mafia and one doctor are picked at random and told to choose a user. Whoever the mafia picks is killed, or removed from the game, unless the doctor picks the same person, in which case they are "saved," and kept in the game. Then, the "day" segment of the game begins, and the users are allowed to digitally message with each other for 30 seconds. After this discussion, the users each vote on a person to "hang," or remove from the game. In the event of a tie, one of the tied users is chosen at random. Users removed from the game can spectate, but cannot be a part of the chat or vote. The game ends when either only mafia are left in the game (the mafia win) or only non-mafia are left in the game (villagers/doctors win).
